web scraping on site blockchain-expo


This is a web srapper that I created when I wanted to gather information on some of the great minds of blockchain technology. I found a website 'Blockchain-expo' that has listed down many experts of blockchain technology. I created this python script to extract the data like experts' name, their designation and company name etc. this scripts also searches details of those experts like their LinkedIn profile, wikipedia pages, etc directly from the internet and saves this information in organised way in a CSV file.

file.csv is the o/p of the code.
